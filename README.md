# TheCoolerLuxord
Luxord ups his game and replaces his deck with Balatro cards.

PC Exclusive currently

Replaces the Bomb with the logo for The Flint and replaces the Clock with the Hieroglyph voucher, and changes the back of Luxord's cards to the Plasma Deck.

There is also a folder for alternate decks, currently I have the Abandoned, Anaglyph, Erratic, and Painted Decks in addition to the Plasma Deck. 

Within each of THOSE folders are also further alternates, giving the option for the Petroglyph for the Clock, and giving the Rocket and Obelisk Jokers and The Plant as other options for the Bomb. 

To change decks, simply copy the contents of the deck folder and replace the base "remastered" folder with the alternate. For changing the individual cards, I've included the .dds files under the correct name. 

I have the default options labeled and included under the alternates, so you don't have to worry about keeping a separate folder for changing them around.
