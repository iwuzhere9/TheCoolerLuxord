# TheCoolerLuxord
Luxord ups his game and replaces his deck with Balatro cards.

PC Exclusive currently

Replaces the Bomb with the logo for The Flint and replaces the Clock with the Hieroglyph voucher, and changes the back of Luxord's cards to the Plasma Deck.

Sora's Forms when you fail his Reaction Command has also been updated to match your deck (or just have Jimbo, in the case of the die)

There is also a folder for alternate decks, currently I have the Abandoned, Anaglyph, Erratic, and Painted Decks in addition to the Plasma Deck. 

There are also alternates for the Bomb and the Clock, with the variants nested in the alternate decks.



To change decks, simply copy the contents of the deck folder and replace the base "remastered" folder with the alternate. 

For changing the individual cards, I've included the .dds files under the correct name. Copy it from the original alternate folder and paste it into the "remastered/obj/[relevant folder name]" folder. 

I haven't done extensive testing, so I would recommend having the textures match between `"B_EX210.mdlx" and "B_EX210_EH.mdlx"` and for `"M_EX950_CARD.a.us" and "M_EX950_CARD.mdlx"` to avoid any instability.


If you have any issues, reach out to me and I'll be happy to make any needed changes.



Credits to LocalThunk for making Balatro, the Dax Torture Squad for the KH3 Cursed Mod streams where the idea came to me, and I guess Valve since I made the mod on my Steam Deck idk
